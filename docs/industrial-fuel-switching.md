title:  "Industrial Fuel Switching"
---
Coal use conversion in industry causes industrial facilities to switch to other fuels, such as natural gas and biomass, when running industrial equipment or producing electricity.  Policies promoting fuel conversion can be mandatory (e.g., banning the use of coal in certain industrial facilities), or market-based (e.g., taxing the use of coal or offering tax credits or incentives to use other fuels). Policies that price carbon emissions also create an incentive for facilities to switch away from using coal as a fuel.

This policy may also represent electrification of industry, replacing coal or natural gas-fired processes with electrical processes.
