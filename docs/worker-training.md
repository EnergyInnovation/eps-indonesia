title:  "Worker Training"
---
Enhanced worker training and improved worker practices can reduce emissions created in industrial manufacturing processes.  For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that improved inspection and maintenance at offshore oil platforms has the potential to avoid 32,666 tons of CO2e every year—and that’s just one process in one industry.

Worker certification and education programs can improve practices and lower emissions.  Alternatively, standards can require certain industrial inspection and maintenance protocols to better manage industrial flows and processes.
