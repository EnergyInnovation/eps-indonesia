title: "Reduce Transmission and Distribution Losses"
---

Transmission and distribution losses in the electricity sector occur when the amount of electricity generated is greater than the amount of electricity delivered to end-users. Losses occur from both [technical causes](http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/total-losses-in-power-distribution-and-transmission-lines-1), for example from distribution lines that are too long or inappropriately sized conductors, as well as non-technical causes, for example theft, which is especially common in some emerging economies.

There are a [number](http://www.4cleanair.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Chapter_10.pdf) of ways to reduce transmission and distribution losses.  Some of the options to reduce technical losses include: replacing incorrectly sized transformers, improving the connection quality of conductors (power lines), and increasing the availability of reactive power by installing capacitor banks along transmission lines. To reduce non-technical causes, policymakers can target theft by making it harder to steal power from lines.
