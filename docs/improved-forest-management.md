title:  "Improved Forest Management"
---
Improved forest management practices increase the carbon uptake and improve the ecosystem services provided by existing forestland. These might include enhanced thinning techniques, longer rotation periods, and other changes to timber harvesting. One of the primary ways in which these practices are promoted is through the use of certification programs, for example the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Society of American Foresters (SAF) in the United States.

Certification programs help ensure that timberland is being sustainably managed and can help increase awareness of and value for products that are derived from these timberlands. Similarly, building certification or standards programs can require that wood used in construction comes from sustainably managed forests. For example, the U.S. Green Building Councilâ€™s LEED program awards points for buildings that use FSC certified wood products. Together, certification and standards programs can create awareness of sustainable forest management practices and create a value for these practices that encourages their adoption.
