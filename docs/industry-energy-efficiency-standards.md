title:  "Industry Energy Efficiency Standards"
---
Industrial energy efficiency standards set minimum allowable energy efficiency criteria for existing and newly constructed plants, taking into account different types of raw materials, fuels, and capacities.  Standards might include minimum efficiency criteria for specific pieces of equipment (e.g., motors or belts).  Standards can also be based on production (e.g., energy use per ton of cement production).  Energy performance standards should target the enterprises that produce energy-intensive materials.
