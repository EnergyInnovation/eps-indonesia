title:  "Least Cost Dispatch"
---

In regions with electricity markets, power plants are dispatched to generate electricity based on each plant's cost to generate. The higher a power plant's costs to generate, the lower the chances it will be dispatched to generate electricity in any given hour. During each hour, plants are dispatched in order of cost in order to meet the level of demand required during that hour. The process of determining which plants are dispatched is referred to as a "dispatch order" or "dispatch policy."

In other regions, governments may guarantee some power plants the right to run for a set number of hours per year or to produce and feed into the electric grid a certain amount of power per year.  They may do this in order to ensure that specific power plants, such as coal or nuclear plants, can recover their full costs, even if cheaper sources of power are avilable.  In some cases this can lead to these cheaper sources of power being "curtailed," or turned off even when they are providing cheaper (often free) power. This can lead to more pollution and higher electricity prices for consumers.

Under a "least cost dispatch" mechanism, the power plants with the lowest generation costs are allowed to dispatch power to the grid before plants with higher marginal costs, as in the case of electricity markets.  This minimizes costs to electricity buyers.  In cases where renewables are curtailed to allow other plant types to fulfill their guaranteed dispatch amounts, least cost dispatch also has the effect of lowering pollution.  Least cost dispatch benefits both the environment and the economy, but it may face political resistance from fossil fuel producers or utilities whose assets may become less profitable.
