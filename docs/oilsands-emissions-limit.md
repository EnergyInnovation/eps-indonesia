title:  "Oilsands Emissions Limit"
---

A limit on emissions from a particular industry, in this case oilsands production, places a limit on the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from that industry, while allowing companies to determine how best to comply with the limit. The regulated industry can meet the emissions limit through better efficiency, captured emissions, or other mechanisms. In some instances, industries can buy and sell tradable permits with one another to meet the emissions limit.

In the case of Alberta, in 2016, the provincial Government [established a 100-megaton limit](http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/O07p5.pdf) on carbon emissions from the oilsands sector. (The Act had not been translated into regulation as of June 2019.) A [2018 analysis by the Pembina Institute](https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/050/documents/p65505/125100E.pdf#page=139) suggests the limit may be reached in 2025. This parameter is used to model this policy in the Canada and Alberta instances of the Energy Policy Simulator.
