title:  "Reduce Fossil Fuel Exports"
---
This policy lever may be used to represent a reduction in demand for fossil fuels from outside the modeled region, rather than a policy implemented by the modeled region itself.  In this case, the policy lever can help domestic policymakers understand how they would respond to a drop in other countries' demand for fossil fuels.  This can be an important concern for fuel-exporting countries, as policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and competition from new technologies (such as solar and wind power, electric vehicles, etc.) may reduce fossil fuel demand in the coming century.

This lever may also represent domestic efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuel exports.  For example, not permitting or building sufficient export capacity, such as pipelines or terminals, can have the effect of limiting fossil fuel exports.
