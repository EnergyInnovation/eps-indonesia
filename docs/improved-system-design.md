title:  "Improved System Design"
---
Installation and system integration improvement policies aim to improve the way industrial facilities are constructed and reduce the amount of energy needed to complete industrial processes.  Policies targeting these improvements should focus on training, technical assistance, and financial incentives.

Adequate training should be available for architects, contractors, and engineers at industrial facilities.  By better training the technicians who will design and build facilities, system integration can be significantly improved.

Technical assistance should also be easily available for businesses looking to build industrial facilities. The availability of technical guidance will help reduce costs when designing facilities and streamline energy-conserving practices.

Finally, financial incentives can be offered for facilities that meet certain energy performance criteria to encourage efficient facility design.
