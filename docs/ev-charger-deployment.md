title:  "EV Charger Deployment"
---
Although most owners of electric vehicles (EVs) [predominantly charge their vehicles at home](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/69031.pdf), widespread deployment of EVs requires a network of public and private charging infrastructure.  These chargers benefit EV owners when they are away from home, as well as renters who may be unable to install a home charger as well as car owners who lack off-street parking.

There are a variety of policy approaches to promote EV charger deployment.  For example:

* Building codes may mandate the inclusion of chargers (or at least the supporting conduit, wiring, and electrical capacity) for a percentage of newly constructed parking spaces, particularly in large apartment or office buildings.
* Government and utilities may offer rebates to homeowners or business owners to pay for part of the cost of EV chargers, including installation costs.
* Government may use its own funds, such as those derived from a carbon tax, low carbon fuel standard, or vehicle fuel taxes, to directly pay for the construction of public charging stations.
* An electricity regulator, such as a public utilities commission, may direct electric utilities to build EV charging stations, funded by a grant from the government, revenues from electricity ratepayers, or a combination of the two.
* Regulators may set more favorable electricity rates for EV chargers, lowering operational costs and thereby improving the financial incentive to build and operate EV chargers.
* Local governments can [streamline their permitting process](http://businessportal.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GoBIZ-EVCharging-Guidebook.pdf) for EV charger installation.  They may also modify zoning laws to allow charging station installation at the curbside.

For commercial fleet vehicles, buses, and mobility services (fleets of company-owned EVs for car-sharing), private chargers are typically located in a central depot, garage, or holding facility, allowing vehicles to charge in between scheduled services.
