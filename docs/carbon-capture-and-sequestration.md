title:  "Carbon Capture and Sequestration"
---
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) policies promote the use of CCS technologies at power plants and industrial facilities.  These policies typically consist of sector- or economy-wide carbon pricing policies, or emissions limits for facilities.

Carbon pricing policies, such as a [carbon tax](carbon-tax.html) or cap-and-trade, create an economic incentive for CCS by reducing the cost of compliance (under both a carbon tax and cap-and-trade) and in some cases by creating a financial product that can be sold (under cap-and-trade when the CCS facility is within the cap or produces credits at below the permit price). 

CO<sub>2</sub> emissions limits are another way of encouraging CCS.  These limits set maximum emissions rates for facilities burning fossil fuels, requiring the owners to install CCS in order to receive a permit.  Emissions limits can be set either by the type of facility being regulated (e.g., different values for a coal power plant versus a natural gas power plant) or, better yet, can be set at one consistent value across a sector.  In the latter case, emissions standards may result in less CCS facilities if it is more cost-effective to use a different technology that produces power or industrial products below the emissions limit.
