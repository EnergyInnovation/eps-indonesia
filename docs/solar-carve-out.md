title: "Distributed Solar Carve-Out"
---

A carve-out is a requirement that a specific amount of electricity generation come from a particular technology. Generally, carve-outs are found in [Renewable Portfolio Standards](renewable-portfolio-standard.html) (RPS) to mandate that a minimum proportion of the RPS requirement is met by a particular technology. A [distributed solar carve-out](http://spotforcleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4c03691956c365e18d25da6bc16af7c2.pdf) requires a specific share of electricity generation is met by distributed solar photovoltaics. [Colorado](http://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/133), for example, has a distributed solar carve-out within its RPS which requires 3% of retail sales to come from distributed generation by 2020.
