title:  "Grid-Scale Electricity Storage"
---
Grid-scale electricity storage policies require minimum levels of energy storage such as batteries, pumped hydro, or compressed air, to store electrical energy.  Typically, storage policies set a minimum level of storage capacity that must be achieved in a target year with clear, annual targets ramping up to the final year value.  This additional storage increases the flexibility of the electric grid, enabling a more dynamic balance between variable generation and variable demand. 

Because energy storage represents a rapidly developing set of technologies, policies should be technology neutral and focus on acquiring storage capacity at least-cost.  Reverse auctions, in which developers submit bids to the body choosing projects, are an effective mechanism for minimizing costs and remaining technology neutral.
