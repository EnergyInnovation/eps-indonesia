title: "Avoid Deforestation"
---

Avoided deforestation requires implementing policies and practices that limit the legal or illegal removal of native forestland. There are a [handful of options](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch9s9-6-1.html) available to policymakers to try and reduce deforestation. These include: legally protecting forests through the creation of designated protected areas, requirements that private landholders maintain a minimum fraction of forest cover, and payments to landowners for providing environmental services through maintaining forest cover. All of these require rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms in order to be effective.
