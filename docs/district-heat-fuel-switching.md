title:  "District Heat Fuel Switching"
---
Many district heat plants burn fossil fuels to generate heat.  District heat plants are often owned by the government or regulated utilities and can be required to transition to cleaner fuels, such as biomass or hydrogen.  Utility regulators may allow district heat utilities to recover the costs of new capital equipment in their energy rates.
